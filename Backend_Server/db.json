The house is a Victorian Terrace dating from about 1850 has bare brick walls and high ceilings and lots of light, I converted the ground floor so it's one big living space which creates a loft style feeling. The room is large and light with wooden floors, it used to be my painting studio. There is plenty of room and an easy chair and table so you can hang out there comfortably and it's near the shared bathroom. You are welcome to make your own breakfast and coffee in the kitchen in the mornings. My guests",

Often, I fly to my destination after work and as such my interaction with guests is limited. If I do not get the chance to meet guests I will leave my key for them in a pre arranged place and they will be fully accommodated for them upon arrival. My neighbourhood is basically Fulham which is a lovely area. There are many local parks and dozens of shops to suit your needs. If you're looking for bars, there are plenty within waking distance in Hammersmith and in Fulham too so the nightlife is great! You'll have lots to do here and in the city so go have fun!

The room is warm, tranquil and bright with a comfy double bed, fresh sheets, towels, wardrobe and drawers. Tea & coffee making facilities + everything you need for cooking are in the kitchen, which is shared with me as well as the bathroom. There are car parking spaces in front of the building, though not secured but free. The place is only a few minutes away from Oxford / Wilmslow roads where all the famous bars, cafes and take away can be found. There are many grocery shops (Tesco, Sainsbury's and other corner shops) within 5-7 mins walk. Also, there is a 24hrs petrol station (groceries, ATM) just round the corner. You can access and feel free in every corner of the flat during the day time. I'm relaxed and open to help or give some advice about directions though I'm quite busy as I'm a post grad student at UoM, so most of the time I go early in the morning and come back around 6 pm.",

We figured that as its often hard to find a good green place to stay, and especially so with a family it makes sense to offer our place whilst we are on our travels! We hope also to use air bnb on our way too! So, whilst we are away, The Elmwood Shack would love to welcome green travellers, especially cyclists, climbers, walkers, wee green families and anyone with who loves low impact green living and travel. The location and space suits adventurous types who want to get out and about and explore the city but also love to be near the beach, close to open green spaces, and like to come home after an active day and curl up with a book and some good food in front of the fire, or head out to some fantastic traditional pubs a",
